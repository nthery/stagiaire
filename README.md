# Stagiaire

This Rust crate provides a [string interner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interning).

Please refer to crate documentation for details.

There are already several similar crates but I've been using this one in various personal projects and I needed an excuse to learn how to publish to [crates.io](http://crates.io).
